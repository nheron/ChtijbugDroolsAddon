# Car Insurance Calculator

This project is used by the jbpm tutorial.

The purpose is to implement a calculator that shall give a a list of prices to insure a car for a given car and a list of drivers.

The car data contains when it was first registered, the fiscal power, the brand name and the model name

In Input, the calculator should receive a quote requet, containing the car , the list of drivers. The calculator should send back the same request object with added objects :

* the list of propositions with options

* the list of yellow or red rules that were fired.


If a red rule is fired, the calculation can stop. If a yellow rule is fired, the calculation can continu.

| Red Rule name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OnlyDriverUnder18yearsold | If there is only one driver given and the age is under 16 years old. |


| Yellow Rule Name | Description |

| OneDriverBetween16And18YearsOld | If one driver is between 16 and 18 years and no other driver is over 25 years old and has no accident in the last 2 years and maximum 2 accidents in the last 5 years |
| OneDriverTooOld | If one driver is over 75 years old |

| 16 | 18 | | | +20% |
| 18 | 30 | 0| 0| +5% |
| 18 | 30 | 0| 2 | +10% |
| 18 | 30 | 2| 4| +12% |
| 30 | | 0| 0| +0% |
| 30 | | 5 | 5 | +10% |

All other cases +25% per driver

If more than 4 drivers are declared in the request, starting from the fourth driver and over are free. The 3 drivers to take are the most expansive.

At the end, there can be only one yellow rule that can be fired.
